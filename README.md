# Menu Bar DNS

Here I track the build progress of a macOS Menu Bar DNS app written for Big Sur in Swift. I am doing so in the open using Github, paying appropriately skilled developers to create the code.

1. [Issue #1](https://github.com/ivanstegic/menu-bar-dns/issues/1) - [Release v0.0.1](https://github.com/ivanstegic/menu-bar-dns/releases/tag/v0.0.1) - A basic Xcode project that compiles, with an icon in the Menu Bar 
2. [Issue #5](https://github.com/ivanstegic/menu-bar-dns/issues/5) - (Release in progress) - Add app icons and menu items
