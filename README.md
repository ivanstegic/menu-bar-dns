# Menu Bar DNS

I have an idea for a macOS Menu Bar DNS app written for Big Sur in Swift, but I need some help getting it built. I'm going to project manage building this app in the open using Github whilst paying appropriately skilled developers to create the code.

1. [Issue #1](https://github.com/ivanstegic/menu-bar-dns/issues/1) - A basic Xcode project that compiles, with an icon in the Menu Bar
2. [Issue #5](https://github.com/ivanstegic/menu-bar-dns/issues/5) - Add app icons and menu items
